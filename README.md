# rrule implementation for Racket

Loosely based on [Python's dateutil
package](https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/rrule.html) (see also
[source](https://github.com/dateutil/dateutil/)), hence the [BSD-3
License](LICENSE).

Aims to implement all relevant feature of [RFC5545 ยง
3.3.10](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5545#section-3.3.10).
